This is my assignment for the bonus of COMP 3005.
It takes plain text input and attempts to create relations and parse queries.
Supported functions include selection, projection, cross join, inner join, natural join, intersection, union, and minus.

Ran out of time in the video, so feel free to ask more questions if they come up!
